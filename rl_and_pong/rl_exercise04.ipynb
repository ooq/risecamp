    "The cell below is a hack. The explanation is as follows. Internally within the `PPOAgent` constructor, a number of actors are created, and these actors will instantiate gym environments using the command `gym.make('PongJS-v0')`. The command `gym.make` knows how to instantiate a number of pre-defined environments that are shipped with the `gym` module. However, the `PongJS-v0` environment is defined in the `pong_py` module and is registered with the `gym` module when the `import pong_py` statement gets run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for the actors to successfully instantiate the gym environments, the `pong_py` module must be imported on the actors. This is why we define a remote function `import_pong_py` which closes over the `pong_py` environment. When the actors are created, that remote function is unpickled on the actors which forces the `pong_py` module to be imported, which enables the `gym` module to create the `PongJS-v0` environment."
