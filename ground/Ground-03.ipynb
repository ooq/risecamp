Instead of an `add_file` method in that example, we're going to implement an `add_dir` method that takes in the path of a directory, generates a list of all the files in it, and adds each one of those files to Ground. \n",

As an advanced example, imagine how to use Ground to capture all the activity of a user in a Jupyter notebook!"
